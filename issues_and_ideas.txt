I'm tired of writing TODOs in random places so I'll continue here.

=========== Issues =====================
* Add README.md
* Remove debug prints
* In ping_subnet::ping: we print the host address and host status from different methods which is a bad practice. 
Make sure we have an "orchestrator" method who collects data (host address, DNS and status) from other methods and forms an output string.
I.e. we need to form an output string and print it from a single method, not across the whole module. 
* in *.cpp files: define public methods first and then private ones.
* in Socket::receive_packet() pass &vector instead of char*.
* in IPAddress:IPAddress() add argument host_order=True.
This will allow passing either host or network order IP and convert it inside the contructor if necessary.

=========== Ideas ======================
* sort out the mess of shared_ptr vs shared_ptr& when passed to different methods and classes.
Do we actually need shared_ptr in all of those cases?

* send/receive ICMP packets in parallel (e.g. one host - one thread). Use POSIX threads.
* Print some extra data to the user output: TTL, time delay.
* Add support for Windows, use autotools if required.
* in Socket::configure_socket: find a way to initialize timeValue struct during the function call in args list (on the go).
* Change this:
            See 'man capabilities' and 'man setcap' for more info.
    To:
            See README for more info.
    And put all this info into readme (once README is created).
