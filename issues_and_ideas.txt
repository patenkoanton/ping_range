I'm tired of writing TODOs in random places so I'll continue here.

=========== Issues =====================
* Add README.md
* Issue described in 15dc408 is fixed, but still reproducable if we run ping_subnet, and in parallel - ping the host from that subnet.
In that case ping_subnet might still freeze. Find a way to fix it. POssible solution - use icmp_seq field.
* Sometimes when we ping a lot of hosts (e.g. 8.8.8.0/22) we might run out of memory because std::vector<hosts> becomes too big.
MASSIVE OPTIMIZATION: find a way to ping every single host once it's generated so it's not kept in memory for longer than required.
* gethostaddr hangs up for a long time when unable to resolve the name look up (example host: 8.8.9.1).
This is a common issue with gethostaddr(). The following functions/utilities share this problem (tested with 8.8.9.1 host):
        * getnameinfo
        * nslookup
        * host (command line utility)
Potential cause: DNS server is not configured correctly making DNS lookups slow / inefficient.
This behavior seems faulty: even with improperly configured DNS server the lookup shouldn't block forever (10+ seconds) cause the application stuttering.
Also, there does not seem to be an easy replacement function "out-of-box".

Wheel-invention-idea: let's write a primitive DNS lookup that won't be blocking in case of prolonged / unsuccessful DNS lookup.
It should also have a timeout as an input value.

=========== Ideas ======================
* Add support for Windows, use autotools if required.
* Change this:
            See 'man capabilities' and 'man setcap' for more info.
    To:
            See README for more info.
    And put all this info into readme (once README is created).
