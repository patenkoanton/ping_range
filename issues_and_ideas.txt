I'm tired of writing TODOs in random places so I'll continue here.

=========== Issues =====================
* When generating the range of addresses, make sure the last octet is not 0x00 or 0xFF as those addresses are reserved or unused by convention.
* Replace c-string functions with std::string equivalents
* Make the usage of {} in functions consistent across the entire project
* Fix spacing (number of newlines) between function implementation and macros/includes in *.cpp modules.
* in receive_icmp_response find a way to check if number of bytes received matches the length of ICMP packet
* program blocks forever when ping utility is running in parallel. Apparently it chokes under the flow of packets and stays in receive-loop forever.
Find a way to fix it.
* Find a way to run the application without root access
* Add README.md
* Remove debug prints

=========== Ideas ======================
* send/receive ICMP packets in parallel (e.g. one host - one thread). Use POSIX threads.
* Sometimes hosts reply through proxy within the same subnet, example: 77.38.21.238\32.
    77.38.21.238 will reply through 77.38.21.239 (proxy server). Dumb idea: maybe we can find out if host is talking through proxy.

* Print some extra data to the user output: TTL, time delay.
* Decrease socket timeout to 3-4 seconds
* Add support for Windows, use autotools if required.
