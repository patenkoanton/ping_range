I'm tired of writing TODOs in random places so I'll continue here.

=========== Issues =====================
* Add README.md
* Issue described in 15dc408 is fixed, but still reproducable if we run ping_subnet, and in parallel - ping the host from that subnet.
In that case ping_subnet might still freeze. Find a way to fix it. POssible solution - use icmp_seq field.
* Sometimes when we ping a lot of hosts (e.g. 8.8.8.0/22) we might run out of memory because std::vector<hosts> becomes too big.
MASSIVE OPTIMIZATION: find a way to ping every single host once it's generated so it's not kept in memory for longer than required.


=========== Ideas ======================
* Add support for Windows, use autotools if required.
* Change this:
            See 'man capabilities' and 'man setcap' for more info.
    To:
            See README for more info.
    And put all this info into readme (once README is created).
