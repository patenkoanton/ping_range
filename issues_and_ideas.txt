I'm tired of writing TODOs in random places so I'll continue here.

=========== Issues =====================
* program blocks forever when ping utility is running in parallel. Apparently it chokes under the flow of packets and stays in receive-loop forever.
Find a way to fix it.
* Add README.md
* Remove debug prints
* In ping_subnet::ping: we print the host address and host status from different methods which is a bad practice. 
Make sure we have an "orchestrator" method who collects data (host address, DNS and status) from other methods and forms an output string.
I.e. we need to form an output string and print it from a single method, not across the whole module. 
* receive_icmp_reply: instead of passing "sockaddr_in receiver" and "socklen_t receiverLength" we should pass NULL for both of them (reason: not being used).
    

=========== Ideas ======================
* send/receive ICMP packets in parallel (e.g. one host - one thread). Use POSIX threads.
* Print some extra data to the user output: TTL, time delay.
* Add support for Windows, use autotools if required.
