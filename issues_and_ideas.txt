I'm tired of writing TODOs in random places so I'll continue here.

=========== Issues =====================
* Add README.md
* Issue described in 15dc408 is fixed, but still reproducable if we run ping_subnet, and in parallel - ping the host from that subnet.
In that case ping_subnet might still freeze. Find a way to fix it. POssible solution - use icmp_seq field.

=========== Ideas ======================
* send/receive ICMP packets in parallel (e.g. one host - one thread).
* Add support for Windows, use autotools if required.
* Change this:
            See 'man capabilities' and 'man setcap' for more info.
    To:
            See README for more info.
    And put all this info into readme (once README is created).
