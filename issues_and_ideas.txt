I'm tired of writing TODOs in random places so I'll continue here.

=========== Issues =====================
* When generating the range of addresses, make sure the last octet is not 0x00 or 0xFF as those addresses are reserved or unused by convention.
* Replace tabs with whitespaces
* Replace printf with cout (any way to replace perror as well????)
* Replace c-string functions with std::string equivalents

=========== Ideas ======================
* "Ping range" sounds kinda cripled. Lets rename the whole project to "ping subnet".
All the modules and variables that contain "ping range" should be removed as well.

* Dumb idea: take address generator object out of ping range class and let main handle the fuckery.
