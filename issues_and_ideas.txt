I'm tired of writing TODOs in random places so I'll continue here.

=========== Issues =====================
* Add README.md
* Issue described in 15dc408 is fixed, but still reproducable if we run ping_subnet, and in parallel - ping the host from that subnet.
In that case ping_subnet might still freeze. Find a way to fix it. POssible solution - use icmp_seq field.
* We are getting a weird bug if we add a new field to Ping class and rebuild the project without rebuilding the factory.o:

ping_subnet: malloc.c:2374: sysmalloc: Assertion `(old_top == (((mbinptr) (((char *) &((av)->bins[((1) - 1) * 2])) - __builtin_offsetof (struct malloc_chunk, fd)))) && old_size == 0) || ((unsigned long) (old_size)
 >= (unsigned long)((((__builtin_offsetof (struct malloc_chunk, fd_nextsize))+((2 *(sizeof(size_t))) - 1)) & ~((2 *(sizeof(size_t))) - 1))) && ((old_top)->size & 0x1) && ((unsigned long) old_end & pagemask) == 0)'
 failed.
Aborted

Steps to reproduce:
        - git reset --hard 4ffb42f
        - make && make install
        - add a new field "uint_32t temp = 0" into the body of Ping class.
        - make && make install && ./ping_subnet 157.240.8.32/27
However, the bug goes away if we run 'make clean' or remove factory.o so it gets rebuilt.
Find out what is this strange behavior of factory object (memory related?)
It could be something template-related. Maybe templates are generated in a way that affects memory and is dependend on the size of class.
I.e. adding new members to a class messes up with generated template methods.


=========== Ideas ======================
* Add support for Windows, use autotools if required.
* Change this:
            See 'man capabilities' and 'man setcap' for more info.
    To:
            See README for more info.
    And put all this info into readme (once README is created).
